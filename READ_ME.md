# Welcome to Greeneye

Greeneye is a satellite images classifier aiming to tackle deforestation in the Amazon bassin. This app is based on the Kaggle dataset "[Understanding the Amazon from Space](https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space)" 
and has initially been developed as a student project at the end of [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/)'s bootcamp.

For 8 days days, Tom√°s Di Gennaro, Vinicius Moura and Guillaume Vanderwinden have developed it from scratch.
